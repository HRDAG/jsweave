# jsweave

Code to weave data literals into LaTeX, with defaults, so that the LaTeX code can be edited interactively without `knitr` or `Sweave`.

#Usage Overview 

This tool was built to help mitigate having to go back and forth to udpate your calucations. Instead you can use jsweave's 
marker to tag each number and this will allow you to keep your numbers calculated and up to date. 

```
jsweave --help 
```
